How do I reverse a string in Python?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

You can reverse a string in Python using slicing:

```python
reversed_string = your_string[::-1]
```

Alternatively, you can use `reversed()` with `join()`:

```python
reversed_string = ''.join(reversed(your_string))
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

What if I want to reverse each word in a sentence but keep their order?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
