//! Pipeline Nodes
//!
//! A `ServicePipeline` is a directed graph of nodes where each node defines a behavior for both
//! forward/request path and the backward/response path. The allowed behaviors in each direction
//! are is either a `Source`, or a `Sink`.
//!
//! A `Frontend` is a the start of a graph and is a [`Source`] for the forward path and a [`Sink`] for the
//! backward path.
//!
//! A `Backend` is the end of a graph and is a [`Sink`] for the forward path and a [`Source`] for the
//! backward path.
//!
//! An [`PipelineOperator`] is a node that can transform both the forward and backward paths using the
//! logic supplied by the implementation of an [`Operator`] trait. Because the [`PipelineOperator`] is
//! both a [`Source`] and a [`Sink`] of the forward request path and the backward response path respectivly,
//! i.e. it is two sources and two sinks. We can differentiate the two by using the [`PipelineOperator::forward_edge`]
//! and [`PipelineOperator::backward_edge`] methods.
//!
//! - The [`PipelineOperator::forward_edge`] returns a [`PipelineOperatorForwardEdge`] which is a [`Sink`]
//!   for incoming/upstream request and a [`Source`] for the downstream request.
//! - The [`PipelineOperator::backward_edge`] returns a [`PipelineOperatorBackwardEdge`] which is a [`Sink`]
//!   for the downstream response and a [`Source`] for the upstream response.
//!
//! An `EdgeOperator` currently named [`PipelineNode`] is a node in the graph can transform only a forward
//! or a backward path, but does not transform both.
//!
//! This makes the [`Operator`] a more powerful trait as it can propagate information from the forward
//! path to the backward path. An `EdgeOperator` on the forward path has no visibility into the backward
//! path and therefore, cannot directly influence the backward path.
//!
