# TensorRT-LLM Integration with Triton Distributed

This example demonstrates how to use Triton Distributed to serve large language models with the tensorrt_llm engine, enabling efficient model serving with monolithic option.

## Prerequisites

Start required services (etcd and NATS):

   Option A: Using [Docker Compose](/runtime/rust/docker-compose.yml) (Recommended)
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   Option B: Manual Setup

    - [NATS.io](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/installation) server with [Jetstream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream)
        - example: `nats-server -js --trace`
    - [etcd](https://etcd.io) server
        - follow instructions in [etcd installation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/) to start an `etcd-server` locally

Note: This example is work in progress.

## Building the Environment

The example is designed to run in a containerized environment using Triton Distributed, tensorrt_llm, and associated dependencies. To build the container:

```bash
# Build image
./container/build.sh --framework TENSORRTLLM
```

## Launching the Environment
```
# Run image interactively
./container/run.sh --framework tensorrt_llm -it
```
