Triton Distributed is a flexible, component based, data center scale
inference serving framework designed to leverage the strengths of the
standalone Triton Inference Server while expanding its capabilities
to meet the demands of complex use cases including those of Generative
AI. It is designed to enable developers to implement and customize
routing, load balancing, scaling and workflow definitions at the data
center scale without sacrificing performance or ease of use.

> [!NOTE] 
> This project is currently in the alpha / experimental /
> rapid-protyping stage and we are actively looking for feedback and
> collaborators.
