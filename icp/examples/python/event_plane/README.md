# Event Plane example

A basic example that demonstrates how to use the Event Plane API to create an event plane, register an event, and trigger the event.

## Code overview

### 1) Initialize NATS server and create an event plane
```python
    server_uri = "nats://localhost:4222" # Optional
    component_id = uuid.uuid4()          # Optional
    plane = NatsEventPlane(server_uri, component_id)
    await plane.connect()
```

### 2) Define the callback function for receiving events
```python
    received_events = []
    async def callback(event):
        print(event)
        received_events.append(event)
```

### 3) Prepare the event event_topic, event type, and event payload
```python
    event_topic = EventTopic(["test", "event_topic"])
    event_type = "test_event"
    event = b"my_payload"
```

### 4) Subscribe to the event event_topic and type and register the callback function
```python
    await plane.subscribe(callback, event_topic=event_topic, event_type=event_type)
```

### 5) Publish the event
```python
    await plane.publish(event, event_type, event_topic)
```
